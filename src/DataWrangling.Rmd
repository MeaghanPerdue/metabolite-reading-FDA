# Data Wrangling for functional analysis of reading-MRS data 
Data from Preschool Study

```{r}
#read in behavioral data from REDCap export
redcap<-read.csv("~/OneDrive - University of Calgary/Preschool_data/REDCap_exports/PreschoolImaging-NEPSYWoodcock_DATA_LABELS_2023-02-22_1010.csv", colClasses=c("Phonological processing total score"="numeric","Phonological processing scaled score"="numeric", "Word Identification Raw Score"="numeric", "Word Attack Raw Score"="numeric", "Word Identification Scaled Score"="numeric", "Word Attack Scaled Score"="numeric"))
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
